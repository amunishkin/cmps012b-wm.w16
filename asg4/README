This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Alexey Munishkin (amunishk@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Diem Phuong Chau (dhchau@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Alexey Munishkin spent       0.0 hours working alone.
Diem Phuong Chau spent       0.0 hours working alone.
We spent                     16.2 hours working together.
Alexey Munishkin spent       8.1 hours driving.
Diem Phuong Chau spent       8.1 hours driving.
